# Color Interpolation

### What is a Color Object?

`colorLeft[];`
An array in P5 takes so myColor = color(123, 123, 35);

___
## ShakeColor();
`shakeColor()` will generate the random colors needed.


### Using the P5 Reference
Vertexes need to be used to make Triangles and hence, make circles

### What does P5 have to say?

All shapes are constructed by connecting a series of vertices. vertex() is used to specify the vertex coordinates for points, lines, triangles, quads, and polygons. It is used exclusively within the beginShape() and endShape() functions.

<br /> 

Using the beginShape() and endShape() functions allow creating more complex forms. beginShape() begins recording vertices for a shape and endShape() stops recording.

### What's it look like in the Code?
  ```javascript
beginShape();
  ```
